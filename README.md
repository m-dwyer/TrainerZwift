# TrainerZwift
Quick and dirty window docking for Zwift and TrainerRoad

## Information

Ensures that Zwift is launched in the top 3/4 of the primary screen, allowing for TrainerRoad to utilize the bottom 1/4.  For those of us who use Zwift and TrainerRoad together

## Usage

1) Launch Zwift (window mode) and click Ride to log in
2) Run this app -- Zwift will be set to top 3/4 of primary screen, and window border removed. TrainerRoad, if not running, will be launched.
3) Choose your TrainerRoad workout, and changet to Minimal mode
4) You can now workout with Zwift and TrainerRoad utilizing the entire screen

May or may not be updated in the future to serialize config to file, allowing for different processes, window positions, border styles, etc.. Although there are probably other tools out there for this already?
